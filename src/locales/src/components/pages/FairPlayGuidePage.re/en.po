msgid "Once at least 4 players are selected (highlighted in green) from the Queue screen, you can generate draws with the blue button on the bottom right. The system will generate all possible combinations of matches for the given players based on the matchmaking strategy selected. Additionally it will show you the relative 'quality' of the matches and sort them from highest to lowest. Quality of the match means whether the match is going to be close or one-sided. The green highlighted match at the top is the 'recommended match' which uses some heuristics to select a match that balances quality while avoiding repeated teams or matches. The list of matches will also highlight previously played matches or pairs in yellow or red. This allows you as the organizer to determine whether to avoid repeated matches. Use the blue button to select a match which will then update the draws for the remaining players that were selected. Keep selecting matches until all players are in a match."
