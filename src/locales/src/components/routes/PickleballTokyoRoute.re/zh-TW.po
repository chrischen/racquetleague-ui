"As mentioned above, public games are not really a thing in Japan. However, "
"you can find some public games on the home page of this website. They will "
"tend to be full with a waitlist so just join the waitlist and cross your "
"fingers. 5-6 spots tend to open up the day of the event as people cancel "
"last minute."

"Japan does not really have public drop in courts or games. Most pickleball "
"games happen indoors at community center and school gymnasiums (multi-use "
"gyms) or on private tennis/pickleball courts and these all require "
"reservations for court time, or reservations to join the events. Many of the "
"public facilities do not allow groups to advertise to the public, which "
"makes it difficult for new players or visitors to drop in on sessions."
